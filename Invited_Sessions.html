                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  AI is seemingly inseparable today. Healthcare using AI is
                  amongst the fastest growing research area across the globe. A
                  massive amount of heterogeneous data generated in healthcare
                  sector offers enormous opportunities for data analytics using
                  AI models. Such analysis transforms data into real and
                  actionable insights to healthcare practices, thus provide new
                  understanding and ways for better and quicker treatment, and
                  improve overall individual and population health. Recent
                  advancements in AI are proving beneficial in development of
                  applications in various spheres of healthcare such as
                  microbiological analysis, discovery of drug, disease
                  diagnosis, Robot-assisted surgery, genomics and proteomics,
                  medical imaging and bioinformatics. Due to increasing
                  availability of electronic healthcare data (structured as well
                  as unstructured data) and rapid progress of data analytic
                  techniques, a lot of research is being carried out in every
                  area of healthcare including Robot-assisted surgery. Popular
                  AI techniques include machine learning/deep learning for
                  structured data and natural language processing for
                  unstructured data. Robot-assisted surgery gives doctors better
                  vision, precision, flexibility and control when they are
                  performing complex minimally invasive procedures. Robots have
                  been used in medicine for more than 35 years. They range from
                  simple laboratory robots to highly complex surgical robots.
                  Surgical robots can either aid a human surgeon or execute
                  operations by themselves. In addition to surgery, robots are
                  used in hospitals and labs for repetitive tasks, in
                  rehabilitation, for physical therapy and to support patients
                  with long-term conditions. Hence, many countries are spending
                  a lot of money today into developing these technologies. The
                  topic of this session is emerging and demanding. Discussion on
                  this topic is need of the hour. It connects four contemporary
                  areas of research: AI, Data Science, Healthcare and Robotics.
                  It will help conference to attract a significant number of
                  attendees from more than one sector such as Engineering &
                  Technology, Medical, and Industry. This session will provide
                  attendees a collective update on developments in healthcare
                  using AI & Robots, challenges, opportunities and future
                  research directions.

                  Robots found their potential application in wide variety of industrial and domestic sectors. 
                  Robots can address labour shortage and provides autonomy in manufacturing industries.
                  High hardware cost and need for powerful computational system hinders the adoption of robotic workforces across various domains.
                  Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) emerges as service orientated architecture making industries to adopt robotic solution without owing the robots. 
                  It enables to generate continuous revenue for robotics companies and consumers to have robotic services seamlessly.
                  In addition, it eliminates overheads on robot maintenance and updates from the customers. 
                  It demands continuous monitoring of robots and enables services on request, which can be achieved with cloud robotics technology.
                  Cloud robotics is an emerging field of robotics embedded with cloud computing, cloud storage, and other internet technologies.
                  It enables robotics hardware and software connected with the stake holders. Use of cloud functionalities, 
                  expands the robot capability beyond it onboard processing potential. Cloud based artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions makes 
                  the robot to equip with intelligence to handle complex tasks. Cloud robotics provide reliable human-robot interaction and enables
                  experiential learning. Applications includes autonomous driving like autonomous mobile robots and self-driven cars uses 
                  cloud computation to plan and navigate on the desired path. Medical surgery robots are operated securely and remotely 
                  using cloud enables services. Domestic robots can be rented for services to perform various domestic functions unsupervised. 
                  Thus, cloud robotic technology enables RaaS business model expending the application spectrum of robotics.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                Industry 4.0 concepts and technology can be used to all forms of industrial businesses, including discrete and process manufacturing, oil and gas, 
                  mining, and other industrial sectors. In discussions about smart manufacturing, key terms like the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT),
                  and Digital Twin are frequently used interchangeably. These terms are crucial to Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing because
                  they give users access to real-time operating data of the equipment they represent. Within Industry 4.0, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) 
                  are seen as the next development in an evolution of on-going improvement and function integration. The Internet of Things (IoT), 
                  artificial intelligence (AI), new integrated systems, enhanced analytics, and other technologies all are involved in the semi-autonomous
                  and autonomous decisions which are important to Industry 4.0. A CPS is a combination of physical components, transducers, and 
                  information technology systems in the context of Industry 4.0. Cyber manufacturing, which provides real-time data collection,
                  analysis, and transparency across all elements of a manufacturing process, is augmented by Industry 4.0. With the aid of
                  industry 4.0 technology, businesses can have better control, visibility, and data visibility across their supply chain. 
                  When cutting-edge technology are implemented into physical frameworks, critical infrastructure may be affected more frequently. 
                  The development of CPS will result in systems that are vastly superior to the current generation of simple embedded systems
                  in terms of capability, adaptability, scalability, resilience, safety, and usability. In order to implement Industry 4.0
                  and integrate CPS to several industries, this study identifies and discusses CPS with embedded processes and its Smart 5C Framework.
